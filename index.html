 <p>I am a physical oceanographer working on NASA's <a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)</a> satellite mission. I’m interested in oceanic variability at the submesoscale (100’s meters to 10’s kilometers), which significantly impacts the large-scale ocean and atmosphere, and ultimately the climate system. As a technologist, I contributed toward the preparation for and evaluation of SWOT, prior to and following its launch in December 2022. Now, I explore science questions that have recently been made possible by SWOT’s unprecedented high-resolution measurements.
	 
 I moved to JPL in 2018 from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, where I worked with a variety of observational platforms to investigate the dynamics of the East Australian Current, and how it influences the shelf waters of eastern Australia. Prior to this, I obtained my PhD from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami. </p>
