	<p>I am a physical oceanographer in the <a href="http://www.oceanography.unsw.edu.au/index.html">Coastal and Regional Oceanography Lab at UNSW</a>. 
	My research focuses on mesoscale and submesoscale ocean current variability. At UNSW, I work with a suite of observational platforms to investigate the structure and variability of the East Australian Current, and how it influences the shelf waters of eastern Australia. These observation platforms include ship deployed instrumentation (CTDs, ADCPs, Triaxus, Drifters, Gliders), moorings and remotely sensed datasets (HF radar, Satellite Imagery). At UNSW I managed the deployment of two new HF radar sites in New South Wales, and currently teach the Physical Oceanography component in a Master's course at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science.
