<font face = "helvetica"><h3>Visualization</h3></font>
I enjoy creating visualizations (see below) that can highlight my research to a broader audience. I will make my code for these visuals available on GitGub so that anyone with a little coding experience can use it to create introductory map plots in 3D like the subpanels below, for their region of interest. Contact me for more information.

  <font face = "helvetica"><h3>Jet Coordinates</h3></font>
  Three of my publications utilize code I wrote during my PhD that transforms 3D velocity data (<i>x, y, t</i>) of a meandering jet from geographical (longitude/latitude) to jet coordinates (cross-stream/alongstream). This new frame of reference makes the maximum velocity core the origin, rather than a geographical location, and reshuffles gridpoints to follow the jet shape/orientation. This greatly improves the time-mean representation of the jet; the sharp velocity and lateral shear of the jet is retained in the time mean, allowing for a better representation of the fluctuating component (more details <u><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JC013286" target="_blank">here</a></u>).

  I am currently working on making this Matlab code available on GitHub in a more generalized form. In the meantime, feel free to contact me for more details.

  <font face = "helvetica"><h3>Python</h3></font>
  I am (slowly!) transitioning to Python. There are some really useful resources for oceanographers (and non-oceanographers alike) online:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>To begin, you need to set up your environment. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>, which makes it so easy (or Miniconda, which is the 'lighter' version). Anaconda also comes with a package manager (<a href="https://conda.io/docs/" target="_blank">Conda</a>), making it easy to install and update additional packages.</li><br>
  <li>Anaconda also includes several work space options, including: Jupyter Notebook (best for online coding, teaching, or sharing); Spyder (if you can't let go of the Matlab-style GUI interface); IPython Console.</li><br>
	  <li>Data Carpentry provides free, easy-to-follow online workshops. A great hands-on starter course is <u><a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/" target="_blank">this one</a></u>. With a little bit of experience, a perfect course for oceanographers is run by <a href="http://people.csiro.au/I/D/Damien-Irving" target="_blank"> Damien Irving</a> <u><a href="https://data-lessons.github.io/python-aos-lesson/index.html" target="_blank">here</a></u>.</li><br>
	  <li> NumPy for Matlab users: <u><a href="http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html" target="_blank">click here</a></u></li><br>
<li>The ultimate resource for <u><a href="http://pyaos.johnny-lin.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank">ocean and atmosphere scientists!</a></u></li>
	</ul>
