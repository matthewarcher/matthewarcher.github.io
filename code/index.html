  <font face = "helvetica"><h3>Jet Coordinates</h3></font>
  Three of my publications utilize code I wrote during my PhD that transforms 3D velocity data (<i>x, y, t</i>) of a meandering jet from geographical (longitude/latitude) to jet coordinates (cross-stream/alongstream). This new frame of reference makes the maximum velocity core the origin, rather than a geographical location, and reshuffles gridpoints to follow the jet shape/orientation. This greatly improves the time-mean representation of the jet; the sharp velocity and lateral shear of the jet is retained in the time mean, allowing for a better representation of the fluctuating component (more details <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JC013286">here</a>).

  I am currently working on making this Matlab code available on GitHub in a more generalized form. In the meantime, feel free to contact me for more details.

  I am (slowly!) transitioning to Python. There are some really useful resources for oceanographers (and non-oceanographers alike) online:<br>
