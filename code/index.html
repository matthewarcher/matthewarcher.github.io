  <font face = "helvetica"><h3>Jet Coordinates</h3></font>
  Three of my publications utilize code I wrote during my PhD that transforms 3D velocity data (<i>x, y, t</i>) of a meandering jet from geographical (longitude/latitude) to jet coordinates (cross-stream/alongstream). This new frame of reference makes the maximum velocity core the origin, rather than a geographical location, and reshuffles gridpoints to follow the jet shape/orientation. This greatly improves the time-mean representation of the jet; the sharp velocity and lateral shear of the jet is retained in the time mean, allowing for a better representation of the fluctuating component (more details <u><a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2017JC013286">here</a></u>).

  I am currently working on making this Matlab code available on GitHub in a more generalized form. In the meantime, feel free to contact me for more details.

  <font face = "helvetica"><h3>Python</h3></font>
  I am (slowly!) transitioning to Python. There are some really useful resources for oceanographers (and non-oceanographers alike) online:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>To begin, you need to set up your environment. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a>, which makes it so easy (or Miniconda, which is the 'lighter' version). Anaconda also comes with a package manager (<a href="https://conda.io/docs/">Conda</a>), making it easy to install and update additional packages.
  <li>Anaconda also includes several work space options, including: Jupyter Notebook (best for online coding, teaching, or sharing); Spyder (if you can't let go of the Matlab-style GUI interface); IPython Console.</li>
	  <li>Data Carpentry provides free, easy-to-follow online workshops. A great hands-on starter course is <u><a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">this one</a></u>. With a little bit of experience, a perfect course for oceanographers is run by <a href="http://people.csiro.au/I/D/Damien-Irving"> Damien Irving</a> <u><a href="https://data-lessons.github.io/python-aos-lesson/index.html">here</a></u>. </li>
	  <li>A quick-start guide to <a href="https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"<Jupyter"</a></li>
</li>

  </ul>
